BIRD-LG
=======

This is a looking glass for the Internet Routing Daemon "Bird".


Software is split in two parts:

 - lgproxy.py:

   It must be installed and started on all bird nodes. It act as a proxy to make traceroute and bird query on the node.
   Access restriction to this web service can be done in file "lgproxy.cfg" (only IP address based restriction for now).

 - lg.py:

   This is the frontend, a web based UI that request informations to all lgproxy.py nodes.
   The domain and the list of all bird nodes can be done.
